# Final Perfect Release Audit

## Scope

This final cleanup pass covers the NMOS CPU/SID2MIDI release package:

- `cpu6502.py`
- `sid2midi.py`
- ROM files
- examples
- tests
- tools
- audit docs
- release validation script

## Cleanup performed

- Removed generated Python cache files from the release.
- Rewrote README to match files actually included in this package.
- Removed misleading references to non-bundled helper exporters.
- Added `QUICKSTART.md`.
- Added `PROJECT_MANIFEST.md`.
- Added `SHA256SUMS.txt` generation.
- Kept audit history under `docs/audits/`.
- Confirmed one-command validation works from a clean tree.

## Validation performed

```text
python3 -m py_compile cpu6502.py sid2midi.py tests/test_cpu6502_nmos_upgrade.py tests/test_cpu6502_final_100_closure.py tools/cpu_opcode_coverage_report.py
python3 -m unittest -q tests.test_cpu6502_nmos_upgrade tests.test_cpu6502_final_100_closure
python3 tools/cpu_opcode_coverage_report.py
python3 sid2midi.py examples/simple_pulse.sid --seconds 1 --report -o /tmp/simple_cpu_final100.mid
```

## Result

```text
Ran 20 tests
OK

handlers: 256/256
official opcodes covered: 151/151
NMOS CPU 100% closure validation OK
```

## Honest boundary

This release is complete for SID2MIDI extraction and batch-safe PSID/RSID playback support. It is not claiming transistor-level 6502, VIC-II, CIA, PLA or analog SID filter equivalence.
